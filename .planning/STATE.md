# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** Agents stop learning alone — when one agent solves a problem, every connected agent benefits
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Agent Connection Loop

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Agent Connection Loop)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-18 — Roadmap created (v2) from 56 v1 requirements across 4 phases; legal/compliance deferred to v2

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 kept deliberately light (14 reqs) — core MCP loop + basic trust only, no advanced security or access control
- [Roadmap]: Legal/compliance (LEGAL-01 through LEGAL-08) and INFRA-06 (EU data residency) deferred to v2 — ship fast, no European compliance overhead
- [Roadmap]: Trust requirements simplified to product-focused (PII stripping + approval gate) not GDPR formalism
- [Pre-build]: Graphiti + FalkorDB + Presidio + GLiNER + FastAPI + Celery + PostgreSQL/pgvector + Next.js recommended by research

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: MCP protocol abstraction layer design needs research — spec evolved rapidly in 2025; v2 breaking changes expected
- [Phase 1]: French-specific PII recognizers (SIRET, SIREN, NIR) have zero native Presidio support — needs research spike
- [Phase 4]: Cold start risk — commons must demonstrate value in first agent session; pre-seeding strategy needed
